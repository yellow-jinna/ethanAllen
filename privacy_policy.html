            <h3>Opt-Out Preference Signals</h3>
            <p>Opt-out preference signals provide consumers with a simple and easy-to-use method by which to exercise the right to opt-out of the selling and sharing of their information. Global Privacy Controls (GPC) or Universal Opt-Out Mechanism (UOOM) are a user-enabled opt-out preference signal which can communicate a user’s “Do Not Sell or Share” request on behalf of the person or device. We will process opt-out preferences from GPC and UOOM signals which are in formats commonly used and recognized by businesses, such as an HTTP field header. We will treat a consumer’s use of GPCs or UOOMs as a valid request to opt-out of the selling and sharing of information for that browser. We currently do not connect browser use to particular consumers and, as such, you will need to use GPCs or UOOMs on all browsers in which you access our website and use our opt-out form to opt-out of offline sales.</p>
            <p>Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set if they do not want web services to collect information about their online activity. We do not respond to DNT signals or other mechanisms (with the exception of GPCs andUOOMs) that provide a choice regarding the collection of personal information about activities over time and across different websites or online services. We encourage users who have DNTs to use GPCs or UOOMs.</p>
            <div>
                <h4>We may collect your personal information for the following business purposes:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>To perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests those goods or services.</li>
                    <li>To detect security incidents that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal information.</li>
                    <li>To resist malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal actions directed at the business and to prosecute those responsible for those actions.</li>
                    <li>To ensure the physical safety of natural persons.</li>
                    <li>For short-term, transient use.</li>
                    <li>To perform services on behalf of the Company.</li>
                    <li>To verify or maintain the quality or safety of a product, service or device that is owned, manufactured, manufactured for, or controlled by the Company, and to improve, upgrade, or enhance the service or device that is owned, manufactured by, manufactured for, or controlled by the Company.</li>

            <h3>Retention of Personal Information</h3>
            <p>We will retain each category of personal information in accordance with our established data retention schedule as indicated above. Some of the retention periods in the retention schedule above are measured from a particular point in time that has not occurred yet, such as the end of employment or end of a relationship (whether business, contractual, or transactional) plus a certain number of years. Where no particular event is defined in the retention schedule as the point from which the retention period is measured, we will measure the retention period from either (1) the date the record or data was collected, created, or last modified, (2) the date of the particular transaction to which the record or data pertains, or (3) another triggering event that is determined to be reasonable and appropriate based on the nature of the data and the legal/business needs for its continued use.</p>
            <p>In deciding how long to retain each category of personal information that we collect, we consider many criteria, including, but not limited to: the business purposes for which the Personal Information was collected; relevant federal, state and local recordkeeping laws; applicable statute of limitations for claims to which the information may be relevant; and legal preservation of evidence obligations.</p>
            <p>We apply our data retention procedures on an annual basis to determine if the business purposes for collecting the personal information, and legal reasons for retaining the personal information, have both expired. If so, we will purge the information in a secure manner.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Third Party Vendors</h3>

Subscribers or site visitors will never receive unsolicited e-mail messages from vendors working on our behalf.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
            <p>In the event we sell or transfer a particular portion of its business assets, information of consumers, contractors and applicants may be one of the business assets transferred as part of the transaction. If substantially all of our assets are acquired, information of consumers, contractors and applicants may be transferred as part of the acquisition.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Compliance with Law and Safety</h3>
