                    <p>Some upholstery pieces have specialized slipcovers that can be ordered through any of our Design Centers. If your piece does not have a specific slipcover, a local Design Center may be able to help you with a custom made slipcover for you.</p>

As always, we recommend that you test any product on the back or underside of your furniture to make sure that it does not react poorly with the finish.</p>
