            <h3>Limitations of Liability</h3>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, you agree that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>with the exception of the express warranties set forth in Ethan Allen’s terms of sales and written warranty policies, Ethan Allen expressly disclaims all warranties of any and every kind, whether express or implied, including, among all others, the implied warranties of fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and merchantability; and</li>
                <li>to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Ethan Allen shall not be liable for any direct or indirect damages of any kind arising out of or in connection with your use of ethanallen.com. The foregoing is a comprehensive limitation of liability and damages that shall apply to all damages of every kind and nature including, without limitation, direct, indirect, compensatory, incidental, punitive, and/or consequential damages, losses, misappropriation, and/or theft of data, goodwill, income, or profit, losses related to property damage of whatever type, and any other tangible or intangible losses or claims of third parties.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, you agree that the maximum collective liability of Ethan Allen for all claims, causes of action, losses, or damages, however arising and by way of whatever type of proceeding, shall be no greater than one hundred dollars ($100). Except as is otherwise prohibited by applicable law, the limitations set forth herein shall apply to any theory of legal liability, including, among all others, breach or repudiation of contract, violation of statute, violation of common law, tort, negligence, gross negligence, recklessness, intentional misconduct, strict liability, or any other claim or damage for any type of civil liability, or based upon any other legal theory and irrespective of whether damages, actual or otherwise, are deemed to exist.</p>
            <p>The provisions of the foregoing paragraphs that impose a damages limitation of one hundred dollars ($100) or otherwise prohibit damages to be multiplied or increased, do not apply in those states, including without limitation to consumers within the state of New Jersey, and the provinces in Canada which do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental, consequential, or another type of damages.</p>

            <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>Please read this section carefully, as these provisions provide for the resolution of disputes through the use of binding arbitration on an individual basis, and also include certain waivers, including waivers of all class actions, class arbitrations, jury trials, and the right to proceed in court (other than arbitration).</p>
            <p>Any legal action relating to the use of ethanallen.com must be brought in the state or federal courts located in the State of Connecticut, Fairfield County.</p>
            <p>You and Ethan Allen agree that any dispute or claim relating to any transaction or interaction with Ethan Allen (including, but not limited to every purchase), these Terms and Conditions, and/or any other aspect or issue concerning the relationship and transactions between you and Ethan Allen, whether pertaining to contract, tort, statute, common law, fraud, misrepresentation, civil liability or any other legal theory (each, a "Dispute") will be resolved in accordance with the provisions in this Legal Disputes section and any other applicable Terms and Conditions.</p>
            <p>Subject to applicable law, these Terms and Conditions and any Dispute arising from or in connection thereto shall be governed by the laws of the United States, including the Federal Arbitration Act, and the laws of the State of Connecticut, without regard to principles of conflicts of law. To the extent prohibited by applicable law, non-U.S. citizens agree to an alternative procedure for dispute resolution if the arbitrator rules that arbitration is prohibited by law.</p>
            <p>Except for disputes that qualify for small claims courts, all disputes arising out of or related to these terms and conditions or any aspect of the relationship between you and Ethan Allen, whether based in contract, tort, statute fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury, and you agree that Ethan Allen and you are each voluntarily surrendering and waiving the right to trial by a judge or a jury. You agree that any arbitration under these terms and conditions will take place on an individual basis. Class arbitration and class actions are not permitted, and you are expressly agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class action.</p>
            <p>The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") under its then-applicable Consumer Arbitration Rules (and shall be subject to all of the Terms and Conditions of this Agreement, which take precedence over any such Consumer Arbitration Rules to the extent permitted by applicable law). The Consumer Arbitration Rules are available online, and can be found at: <a href="https://www.adr.org/industries/consumer" target="_blank">www.adr.org/consumer</a>. To the extent that the AAA cannot or declines to administer the arbitration, the arbitration will be administered by JAMS (formerly, the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services) under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (and shall be subject to all of the Terms and Conditions of this Agreement, which take precedence over any such Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures to the extent permitted by applicable law). The Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures are available online at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/" target="_blank">https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a> (or at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a> to the extent of any updated version and/or if you cannot access or locate the most current version otherwise). If both AAA and JAMS cannot or decline to administer the arbitration, a court of competent jurisdiction may appoint a neutral arbitrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may assert individual claims in small claims court if your claims otherwise qualify.</p>
            <p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's or JAMS' applicable rules, except as set forth herein. To the extent you prevail on the Dispute(s) that are subject to the arbitration, we agree to pay up to, and you agree that you will not seek recovery from Ethan Allen of more than, the total sum of $5,000 for attorney's fees, costs, and expenses associated with the Dispute and the arbitration thereof; provided, however, that in the event you prevail, we also agree that we will pay the costs of the arbitrator's fees and the other costs associated with the arbitration itself. Likewise, even if we prevail, we will not seek attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses associated with the Dispute exceeding $5,000. You agree that if the amount involved in the Dispute is less than $10,000, the arbitration will be conducted, at your election, by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p>
            <p>The arbitrator's decision, which shall be consistent with these Terms and Conditions, will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief and/or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms and Conditions, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by individual claims before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced by any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms and Conditions will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, territorial, or local governments or agencies and, if and to the extent applicable law permits, such entities having jurisdiction may seek relief.</p>
